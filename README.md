# 🎥 PreVuCam – AI-Enhanced Motion Detection Extension

PreVuCam is a Streamlit-based AI extension for traditional camera systems. It enables intelligent motion-based video trimming using frame differencing, reducing storage usage, power consumption, and manual review time.

This system works as an add-on layer over an existing camera module. Users upload recorded footage, and the system automatically extracts motion events into a single compiled video.

## 🚀 Features

- 📤 Upload recorded video files
- 🎯 Automatic motion detection using frame differencing
- ⏱️ 7-second pre-event buffer
- ⏱️ 7-second post-event buffer
- ✂️ Automatic trimming of motion clips
- 📦 Compilation of all detected events into a single MP4 file
- 📥 Download processed output
- 📊 Processing logs for debugging

## 🧠 How It Works

PreVuCam enhances a traditional camera system by:

1. Accepting a recorded video file
2. Running motion detection using frame differencing
3. Identifying motion events
4. Extracting:
   - 7 seconds before the event
   - The motion event itself
   - 7 seconds after the event
5. Combining all event clips into one final video file

This ensures:
- Reduced storage usage
- Lower power consumption
- Faster video review
- Cleaner event-based surveillance

🧩 Code Overview
app.py
1. Handles file uploads
2. Displays original video
3. Executes motion detection script using subprocess
4. Displays logs and output
5. Provides download button

🧩try.py
1. Performs frame differencing
2. Detects motion events
3. Extracts buffered clips
4. Merges clips into a single output file

🔬 Technical Concept
1. This project serves as an AI-powered extension layer to traditional CCTV systems.
2. Instead of continuously storing raw footage, 
PreVuCam:
1. Identifies meaningful motion
2. Stores only relevant segments
3. Eliminates idle recording time

This makes surveillance systems:
1. More efficient
2. More scalable
3. More intelligent
